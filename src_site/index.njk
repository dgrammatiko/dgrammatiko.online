        <p class="center">I like to create/build/assemble things and consider myself a full stack developer (polyglot).</p>

        <p class="center">I've been involved involved in the Joomla CMS for a while as a maintainer, bugsquad member, JS Group lead, GSOC mentor, etc, and have introduced quite some new features (Child Templates, public folder, etc).</p>
        <p class="center">Currently I'm back to Athens/Greece and looking for my next adventure.</p>
